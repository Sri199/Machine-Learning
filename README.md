## 1.Employee Attrition Project

This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition and predicting whether an employee will leave the company using various machine learning models. 
The dataset used contains features such as age, job role, salary, years at the company, and more. Data preprocessing steps involved handling missing values, converting data types, and encoding categorical variables. 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed using pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib to uncover insights and visualize trends, such as the distribution of age, income, job roles, and attrition rates across different categories. 
Several machine learning models were employed, including Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor. The Random Forest Regressor achieved the highest accuracy of 93%. 
The models were evaluated based on their accuracy scores. This analysis provided valuable insights into key factors contributing to employee attrition, aiding organizations in developing strategies to improve employee retention. 
The project involved loading the dataset, preprocessing the data, conducting EDA, building and evaluating machine learning models, and interpreting the results. 
Overall, the project successfully demonstrated the application of data analysis and machine learning techniques to understand and predict employee attrition.
